# <Prework Study Guide Webpage >

## Description
  This study guide will provide quick, understandable, and accessible information to bootcamp students who are enrolled. This contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. The motivation for this webpage is to make these notes easy to find for students who may need a quick reminder. I built this project because I am a student who sometimes needs a quick reminder on something. Instead of searching around for it, I wanted it to be in its own desinated place. I learned that creating a webpage takes a lot of critical thinking. Patience is one of the best things to have when it comes to fixing bugs and looking throughout your code to make sure that you are actually doing things right. I also learned the importance of saving EVERYTHING>

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
Now fill in the details as much as you can, referring to the following tips as you go:
